         After the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent country on 16 December 1971, the existing police force of Bangladesh got remodeled and reshaped as Bangladesh Police and assumed the role of a national police force. Bangladesh Police is primarily responsible for the preservation of peace and order, protection of life and property of the people and prevention and detection of crime within the periphery of the state. The traditional role of police in Bangladesh has undergone significant changes after the liberation. The role of police, at the moment, is no longer confined to maintenance of law and order and prevention and detection of crime. Apart from the mandatory works that needs to be done, there are manifold problems that need taking care of. To meet the need of an independent and developing country, the police is now required to play a significant role in the development process by providing the basic security required for sustained economic growth of the country. Police also is contributing substantially in this field by keeping under control the economic and techno-crimes which retard the process of the development. It is further playing a vital role in disaster management, environment, ecotourism, bio-diversity conservation and so on, which have got enormous impact on state economy and development.

         Bangladesh police, the single most institution entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring rule of law and human rights, is at a cross-road to promote itself to a height to adopt the role of service rather than force, devoted to providing reassurance of service delivery, flexibility to community wishes, cares and social justice.

         It strives to track citizenâ€™s engagement in policing and theiaczr quest for better service, better value and better management. It envisages a new structure erected on the bedrock of information and communication technology, skill adequacy, knowledge-based initiatives and community partnership that will be styled on a schema of cascading change to set a stage for a clear interface between police and citizenry.

         It tends to explore innovative practices in addressing the challenges of the time and reorienting its mission and vision and augment its capacity towards citizen centric service, to uphold professionalism, image and visibility of the service and the value and virtue of the service to the community.
